Django Ajax Upload Widget
=========================

Provides AJAX file upload functionality for FileFields and ImageFields with a simple widget replacement in the form.

No change is required your model fields or app logic. This plugin acts transparently so your model forms can treat files as if they were uploaded by "traditional" browser file upload.


Features
--------

* Drop-in replacement for Django's built-in ``ClearableFileInput`` widget (no change required to your model).
* Works in all major browsers including IE 7+.
* Random hash string added to file names to ensure uploaded file paths are not guessable by others.


Usage
-----

Refer to the ``example`` app included in the package for a working example.

Server Side
'''''''''''

In your form, use the ``AjaxClearableFileInput`` on your ``FileField`` or ``ImageField``.
::

    from django import forms
    from ajax_upload.widgets import AjaxClearableFileInput

    class MyForm(forms.Form):
        my_image_field = forms.ImageField(widget=AjaxClearableFileInput())


Or, if using a ``ModelForm`` you can just override the widget.
::

    from django import forms
    from ajax_upload.widgets import AjaxClearableFileInput

    class MyForm(forms.ModelForm):
        class Meta:
            model = MyModel
            widgets = {
                'my_image_field': AjaxClearableFileInput
            }


Client Side
'''''''''''

Include the Javascript (and optionally CSS) files in your page and call the ``autoDiscover`` function.
This will search the page for all the AJAX file input fields and apply the necessary Javascript.
::

    <link href="{{ STATIC_URL }}ajax_upload/css/ajax-upload-widget.css" rel="stylesheet" type="text/css"/>
    <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}ajax_upload/js/jquery.iframe-transport.js"></script>
    <script src="{{ STATIC_URL }}ajax_upload/js/ajax-upload-widget.js"></script>

    <script>
        $(function() {
            AjaxUploadWidget.autoDiscover();
        });
    </script>


You can also pass options to ``autoDiscover()``:
::

    <script>
        $(function() {
            AjaxUploadWidget.autoDiscover({
                changeButtonText: 'Click to change',
                onError: function(data) { alert('Error!'); }
                // see source for full list of options
            });
        });
    </script>


OR ... you can explicitly instantiate an AjaxUploadWidget on an AJAX file input field:
::

    <input id="Foo" name="foo" type="file" data-upload-url="/ajax-upload/" data-filename="" data-required=""/>
    <!-- The input field needs to be outputed by Django to contain the appropriate data attributes -->

    <script>
        new AjaxUploadWidget($('#Foo'), {
            // options
        });
    </script>


Dependencies
------------
* jQuery 1.7+
* jQuery Iframe Transport plugin (included in this package)


App Installation
----------------

1. Add ``ajax_upload`` to your ``INSTALLED_APPS`` setting.

1. Hook in the urls.
::

    # urls.py
    urlpatterns += patterns('',
        (r'^ajax-upload/', include('ajax_upload.urls')),
    )

1. That's it (don't forget include the Javascript as mentioned above).


Settings
--------

``AJAX_UPLOAD_MAX_FILESIZE`` - Maximum allowed file size in bytes (default: 0).
Setting this greater than 0 will enable validation of uploaded file size.


Running the Tests
-----------------
::

    ./manage.py test ajax_upload
